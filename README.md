# EEngine
A simple component-based code-based engine using Java Swing

EEngine is a one day project and shouldn't be used in a serious way due to instability and lacking performance.
It's structure is heavily influenced by the one of the Unity Engine.

---How To Use---
<h2>Main</h2>
To instantiate new GameObjects at start the main function should be used.
Instantiated GameObjects get automatically added to the game and get initialized the next frame after instantiation.

--GameObject--
GameObjects are used to tie components together
